## 📖 Overview

**Flavor Fusion** is a frontend web application built using **React.js**. It allows users to browse and filter restaurants, view menus, and manage their cart for a seamless food-ordering experience. This project was built while following the *Namaste React* course, where I implemented React's core concepts, advanced optimizations, state management with **Redux Toolkit**, and comprehensive testing with **Jest**.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

Since **Swiggy** doesn’t provide a public API, I’ve used their internal data links. To successfully run this app, you'll need to bypass CORS using the **"Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin"** extension on Chrome. Without this, the app will only display a loading (Simmer UI) screen without restaurant data.

## 🚀 Demo

You can check out the live version of the app here: [Flavor Fusion on Vercel](https://your-vercel-link.com)  
*(Note: Make sure to use the CORS Bypasser extension to load data)*

## 💡 Features

- **Restaurant Search**: Search for restaurants from the fetched dataset.
- **Restaurant Filtering**: Filter restaurants based on cuisine, ratings, etc.
- **Menu Filtering**: Filter restaurant menus by Veg/Non-Veg categories.
- **Cart Functionality**:
  - Add and remove items from the cart.
  - Each item can have a maximum quantity of 5.
  - Clear cart and see full payment details upon checkout.
- **Offline Notifications**: Alerts displayed when the internet connection is lost.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For state management.
- **React Router DOM**: For routing between different pages.
- **SCSS**: For responsive and maintainable styling.
- **Parcel**: For bundling and optimizing the app.
- **Jest**: For unit and integration testing.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control.
- **Vercel**: For deployment.

## 🧪 Testing

This project uses **Jest** for testing:

- **Unit Testing**: Ensures individual components work as expected.
- **Integration Testing**: Tests interaction between components and state.

Run tests using:

```bash
npm run test
```
